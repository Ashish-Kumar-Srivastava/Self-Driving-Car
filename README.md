# Self-Driving-Car
<p>Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or “driverless” cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.

<p>
In a new automotive application, we have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to map the raw pixels from a front-facing camera to the steering commands for a self-driving car. This powerful end-to-end approach means that with minimum training data from humans, the system learns to steer, with or without lane markings, on both local roads and highways. </p>

## Problem Statement 

Building a simplified self driving car where to model we give sequence of images(video here we have 25 minute long) and output model gives is sequence of predicted steering wheel angle.

It is a regression problem which we impose to Deep learning problem.
